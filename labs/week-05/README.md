# Week 5 Lab — Authorization, IDOR, and Offensive Tools

**Lecture:** Authorization and Permissions; Hackers, Offensive Techniques, and Malware

---

## Overview

This week the focus shifts from who you are (authentication) to what you are allowed to do (authorization). HuskyHub has broken access controls at multiple points: students can view other students' grades by changing a URL parameter, advisor-only routes have no server-side role check, and the admin routes trust a cookie value rather than verifying role server-side. You will exploit these manually, then use Burp Suite to automate your findings.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Browser Developer Tools | Manually manipulate URL parameters |
| Burp Suite Community Edition | Intercept, modify, and replay HTTP requests |
| curl | Test authorization checks from the command line |
| Python requests | Automate IDOR enumeration |

**Download Burp Suite Community:** [portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)

Burp Suite is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Download the installer for your platform and follow the standard installation steps. No license is required for Community Edition.

### Platform Notes for curl

**macOS / Linux:** `curl` is pre-installed. Use it directly in Terminal.

**Windows:** `curl` is available in PowerShell 5.1+ and Windows 10+. If you encounter issues, use Git Bash where `curl` behaves identically to macOS/Linux, or install it via `winget install curl.curl`.

## Steps

### 1. Map Authorization-Sensitive Endpoints

**What makes an endpoint "authorization-sensitive":**
An authorization-sensitive endpoint is any URL where the data returned or the action performed should be restricted to a specific user or role. The clearest indicator is an ID parameter in the URL or request body — `student_id`, `user_id`, `doc_id`. These IDs are object references: they tell the server which database record to retrieve. If the server retrieves whichever record the client requests without first confirming the client owns or has permission to access that record, every other user's data is one URL edit away.

Log in as `jsmith`. Compile a list of every URL containing an ID parameter: `student_id`, `user_id`, `doc_id`, `enrollment_id`, etc. This is your IDOR candidate list.

---

### 2. Exploit IDOR on Grades

**What IDOR is and why it is distinct from other access control failures:**
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) occurs when the application exposes a direct reference to an internal object (a database record, a file) in a way the user can manipulate, without verifying authorization before serving the object. The difference between IDOR and a broken login is the *level* at which the control fails: the login check verified you are a valid user, but no check verifies that this valid user is the owner of record number 5. The server trusts the number in the URL.

Navigate to your own grades:
```
http://localhost/grades?student_id=3
```

Now change the `student_id` to each value from 3 to 7. For each, record:
- Whether the request succeeds
- Whose record was returned
- What grade data is exposed

Document whether any server-side check is performed to verify the requesting user owns the record.

---

### 3. Exploit Broken Access Control on Admin Routes

While logged in as `jsmith` (a student), directly navigate to:
```
http://localhost/admin/users
http://localhost/admin/grades
http://localhost/admin/pending
```

For each route, document whether access is granted and what data or actions are exposed. Note that you changed no cookies and sent no special headers — you simply navigated to a URL.

---

### 4. Set Up Burp Suite and Automate IDOR Enumeration

**What Burp Suite is doing as a proxy and what "intercept" means:**
Burp Suite positions itself between your browser and the server as an HTTP proxy. Your browser sends its requests to Burp, Burp forwards them to the server, receives the responses, and passes them back to your browser. This gives you full visibility into every request and response, and the ability to modify either before it reaches its destination. "Intercept mode" pauses each request, letting you read and edit it before clicking Forward to release it. HTTP History shows all captured traffic. Intruder lets you take a single captured request and replay it hundreds of times with a different value substituted in each time — this is how you will systematically enumerate IDOR targets without clicking through the browser manually for each one.

**What Intruder does and what "payload positions" are:**
Intruder is Burp's request automation tool. You mark a parameter value in the request as a "payload position" (using § markers) and provide a list of values to substitute in. Intruder then sends one request per payload value and records every response. For IDOR, you set the `student_id` as the payload position and use a sequential number list as the payload — Intruder effectively sends the same request 20 times with IDs 1 through 20, and you can scan the response lengths and status codes to identify which IDs returned real records versus errors.

Configure your browser to proxy through Burp Suite, then capture and automate the grades request:
1. Open Burp Suite → **Proxy → Intercept → Open Browser**
2. Navigate to `http://localhost/grades?student_id=3`
3. In Burp, find the request in **Proxy → HTTP History**
4. Right-click → **Send to Intruder**
5. Highlight the `student_id` value → **Add §**
6. Under **Payloads**, select **Numbers** from 1 to 20
7. Start the attack and review results

Record every student ID that returns a valid grade record with a name attached, using the response lengths and status codes to tell real records from errors.

> **Note:** Burp Suite Community Edition throttles Intruder attacks. This is expected — it will complete, just slowly.

> **macOS note:** If the Burp browser cannot connect to localhost, go to **Proxy → Options** and ensure the listener is on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Then configure your system browser's proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080` under System Preferences → Network → Advanced → Proxies.

> **Windows note:** Configure your browser proxy under Settings → System → Proxy → Manual proxy setup: `127.0.0.1`, port `8080`.

### 5. (Optional — 0.5 Extra Credit) Find a Second IDOR Endpoint

> **This step is optional.** Completing it correctly is worth **0.5 extra credit points**.

Using Burp's history or by manually browsing, identify at least one additional endpoint vulnerable to IDOR beyond `/grades`. Strong candidates: `/documents/download` (references a file path directly), `/documents/delete` (`doc_id`), and `/enrollment/drop` (`enrollment_id`). Note that `/enrollment` and `/messages` read your `user_id` from the cookie rather than a URL parameter — those are exploited by cookie tampering (Week 5), not by IDOR on a request parameter.

Document: the endpoint, the vulnerable parameter, and what data or action is exposed.

### 6. Remediation — Server-Side Authorization Decorator

**What a Python decorator is and why this pattern is the right approach for authorization:**
A decorator in Python is a function that wraps another function, adding behavior before or after the wrapped function runs. `@require_role('admin')` placed above a route function means "before executing this route, run the `require_role` check — if it fails, abort; if it passes, run the route as normal." The value of this pattern is consistency: rather than copying an `if role != 'admin': abort(403)` check into every protected route (and risking forgetting it), you define the check once and apply it as a decorator. `functools.wraps(f)` copies metadata from the original function to the wrapper so Flask's routing system can still identify the function correctly. `abort(403)` immediately terminates the request with an HTTP 403 Forbidden response.

Create a reusable authorization decorator in `flask/app/auth_utils.py`:

```python
from functools import wraps
from flask import request, redirect, url_for, abort, session

def require_role(*roles):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
            role = session.get('role', 'student')
            if role not in roles:
                abort(403)
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated
    return decorator

def require_own_resource(student_id_param='student_id'):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
            requested_id = request.args.get(student_id_param) or kwargs.get(student_id_param)
            current_user_id = str(session.get('user_id'))
            role = session.get('role', 'student')
            if role not in ('advisor', 'admin') and str(requested_id) != current_user_id:
                abort(403)
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated
    return decorator
```

---

### 7. Apply the Decorators

Apply `@require_own_resource()` to the `/grades` route. Apply `@require_role('admin')` to all `/admin/*` routes. Apply `@require_role('advisor', 'admin')` to `/admin/grades`.

Rebuild and test.

---

### 8. Verify Remediation

Repeat Steps 2 and 3 against the hardened application. Confirm:
- Accessing another student's grades returns HTTP 403
- Accessing admin routes as a student returns HTTP 403
- Legitimate access still works for advisors and admins

Paste the HTTP responses in your report.

## Write-Up Questions

**Q1.** Define Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in your own words. Why does hiding the edit button in the UI fail to prevent IDOR? What is the only reliable place to enforce access control?

**Q2.** Explain the difference between role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC). Which model does your remediation implement? What scenario would require ABAC instead?

**Q3.** Burp Intruder enumerated student IDs 1–20 in seconds. What would a script that automated this against a production application need to do to avoid triggering detection? What defenses would slow it down?

## Hacker Mindset Prompt

IDOR is the simplest class of vulnerability to exploit — change a number, get someone else's data — yet it appears in major production systems continuously. Meta's 2021 data scraping incident, exposing 533 million records, was rooted in an access control failure exploitable through API enumeration.

Reflect on:

- **Contrarian:** The application showed the correct data to the correct user in the UI. A student who only uses the UI would never notice this vulnerability. What does this say about the gap between "works correctly" and "is secure"?
- **Committed:** A committed attacker who discovers an IDOR vulnerability does not stop at one record. Write a Python script (pseudocode is fine) that would exfiltrate the complete grade database using the IDOR you found.
- **Creative:** IDOR becomes significantly harder to exploit if object IDs are not sequential integers. What alternative ID scheme would make enumeration impractical, and what are the tradeoffs?
